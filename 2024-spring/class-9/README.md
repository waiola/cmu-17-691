# 1 Reading summary

Foundations of Decision Analysis by Ron Howard:

The discipline of decision analysis has evolved into a practical approach for making complex decisions by considering multiple factors. Key aspects include addressing uncertainty through subjective probability and assessing risk attitude through utility theory. Central to decision analysis is capturing the structure of problem relationships, often visualized in a graphical problem space. The decision analysis cycle consists of three phases—deterministic, probabilistic, and informational—where variables' importance is determined in various environments.

# 2 Lecture Insights

## 2.1 Definition of Decisions

A choice between >=2 alternatives that involves an irrevocable allocation of resources

## 2.2 Decision Making Systems

### 1 Deliberative Decisions (Where we fall into)

- Reasoned
- Cool
### 2  Affective Decisions

- Emotional
- Hot
## 2.3 Number of Decisions v.s. Amount of Analysis

When Number of Decisions Increase → Amount of Analysis Decrease (vise versa)
## 2.4 Reflection and Action

- Action without Thought
- Thought before Action

## 2.5 Difficulty of Making Decisions
Uncertainty

## 2.6 Decisions vs. Outcomes

- Good Decisions → Good/Bad Outcomes

- Bad Decisions→Good/Bad Outcomes

Problem: Don’t have outcome to guide you when making the decision

Solution: Don’t focus on outcome, focus on making better decisions

## 2.7 Clarity of Action

act with clarity not certainty

## 2.8 Decision Scenario

Probability are very different from person to person

Choice being made are very based on personal state of information

Take Away for ML: give the state of information of the person who we are making decisions for

## 2.9 Decision Modeling Characteristics

- Decision Node: the choice to be made

- Branches: Choices can make (assign probabilities to branches)

- Uncertainty Node: May choose/not choose

have common bases for decision making (same basic line)
